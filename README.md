# Pandas-Challenge
Pandas challenge involved manipulating Pandas DataFrames to analyze School and standardized test data. I was given access to every 
student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task was to aggregate the data 
to showcase obvious trends in school performance. The necessary calculations were made to create high-level snapshots of key metrics
in these dataframes:

- District Summary.
  
- School Summary.
  
- Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing).
  
- Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing).
  
- Math Scores by Grade.
  
- Reading Scores by Grade.
  
- Scores by School Spending.
  
- Scores by School Size.
  
- Scores by School Type.

*Technologies used: Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

*How to activate code: The folder called 'PyCitySchools' has the file 'PyCitySchools.ipnyb'. 
You can open the file in your preferred Python IDEs and run the script.

## Analysis

Studying the data from this assignment has shown me two interesting trends when it comes to charter schools vs district schools. Charter schools have a higher overall passing rate than district schools. When you look at the highest performing schools you can see that the top 5 are charter schools with 1st place being Cabrera High School with a % overall passing rate of 91.3%. On the flip side the 5 bottom performing schools are all distric schools with passing rates much lower at 52-53% with Rodriguez High School at the top of that list. Studying the 'scores by school spending' shows that more money spent does equate to a higher passing rate. Schools with the highest amount of spending '645-680' have the lowest overall passing rate at 53.5(%). As spending to decreases for students, scores increase to around 91.3%. As a whole, the smaller to medium sized schools dramatically out-performed the larger sized schools on passing math performances with figures between 92-94% passing vs 66-67%.
