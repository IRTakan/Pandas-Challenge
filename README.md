# Pandas-Challenge
Pandas challenge involved manipulating Pandas DataFrames to analyze School and standardized test data. I was given access to every 
student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task was to aggregate the data 
to showcase obvious trends in school performance. The necessary calculations were made to create high-level snapshots of key metrics
in these dataframes:

District Summary.
School Summary.
Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing).
Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing).
Math Scores by Grade.
Reading Scores by Grade.
Scores by School Spending.
Scores by School Size.
Scores by School Type.

*Technologies used: Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
*How to activate code: The folder called 'PyCitySchools' has the file 'PyCitySchools.ipnyb'. 
You can open the file in your preferred Python IDEs and run the script.
